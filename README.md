# CompPhys-Exercises
This repo serves to document most of the algorithms implemented in the first half of the Computational Physics Course which I had taken in 2022. 

The repo furthermore includes the main project of the course and its generating files, which focuses on (efficeintly) solving the KDeV differential equation. 

The code in this repo focuses on clear readability over performance, and it includes comments where some more obscure indexing/performance tricks are used nevertheless.
